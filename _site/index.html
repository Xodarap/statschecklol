                <h3>Website Analytics</h3>
                <br />
                We may also partner with selected third-party vendors, such as Google Analytics, to allow tracking
                technologies and remarketing services on the Site through the use of first party cookies and third-party
                cookies, to, among other things, analyze and track users’ use of the Site, determine the popularity of
                certain content and better understand online activity. By accessing the Site, you consent to the
                collection and use of your information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their
                privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal
                information to these third-party vendors. However, if you do not want any information to be collected
                and used by tracking technologies, you can visit the third-party vendor or the Network Advertising
                Initiative Opt-Out Tool or Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool.

                You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading an existing
                browser, or erasing or otherwise altering your browser’s cookies files may also clear certain opt-out
                cookies, plug-ins, or settings.

                THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
                <br />
                The Site may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including
                advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to
                leave the Site, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy
                Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before visiting and
                providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy
                policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those
                steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not responsible
                for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other
                sites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Site.
                <br />
                <h3>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                <br />
                We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal
                information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us,
                please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no
                method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any
                information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.
                Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
                <br />
                <h3>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h3>
                <br />
                We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become
                aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact
                information provided below.
                <br />
                <h3>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
                <br />
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
                activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
                signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
                revised version of this Privacy Policy. Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a
                Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. If you set the DNT signal on your
                browser, we will respond to such DNT browser signals.
                <br />
                <h3>OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information
                from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud,
                troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal
                requirements.
                <br />
                <h3>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h3>
                <br />
